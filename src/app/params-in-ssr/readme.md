# ParamsPage Component in Next.js

`ParamsPage` is a React component in a Next.js application. It is an asynchronous function that returns a Promise resolving to a `JSX.Element`. This is a typical pattern for Next.js components that utilize Server Side Rendering (SSR).

## Server Side Rendering (SSR)

SSR is a technique where the page is rendered on the server instead of the client. This means the page is ready to display as soon as it loads, improving the initial render speed and enhancing SEO.

In the context of `ParamsPage`, the asynchronous function is invoked on the server with an object parameter. The result of this function (the rendered `ParamsPage` component) is then sent to the client as ready-to-display HTML.

## Params and Routing

The `ParamsPage` component accepts an object as a parameter. This object contains a `searchParams` property, which is also an object with a `name` property. The `name` property is a string that represents the name of a user. If the `name` property is not provided in the `searchParams` object, it defaults to the string 'stranger'.

This is made possible by Next.js's routing mechanism, which allows for dynamic passing of parameters to page components. In this case, the `name` parameter is passed to the `ParamsPage` component by the Next.js router.

## Summary

In summary, Next.js enables efficient server-side rendering, speeding up initial render times and improving SEO. Its routing mechanism allows for dynamic passing of parameters to page components, increasing flexibility and customization possibilities. The `ParamsPage` component is a simple example of these concepts in action, displaying a greeting message to a user based on the provided `name` parameter.
